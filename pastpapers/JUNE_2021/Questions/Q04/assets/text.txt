Our bees in the UK are in serious trouble. Many are at the point of facing extinction. If we don’t do something about it soon some species could become extinct and it would then be too late.  It is not just bees that need us – we need them just as much. When bees land on flowers they gather pollen and nectar. Some carry both in one visit, others carry one at a time. The hairs on their back legs are used to store it for transport. A lot of our flowers, fruit and veg are pollinated by bees. When the pollen has been stored and the bee moves off onto another flower some of the pollen is rubbed off and fertilisation occurs. A world without bees would be no world at all. We rely on them so much without even realising!

Bees are declining for several reasons. Scientists have found that some of the flies that visit the same flowers have viruses. They think these are possibly being passed on to the bees, killing some of them. Also the habitat that bees bloom in are becoming more and more scarce. Their habitats are being destroyed to make way for things like roads and housing. Also many people no longer have lush gardens, preferring gardens with little or no maintenance. These gardens do not have the flowers that bees like. 

Also pesticides are used on fruit and vegetables. Many say that if we do not want to worry about this for bees’ health, we should worry about this for our own. Some of these pesticides do not wash off, they are absorbed by every part of the plant, animals eat the plants and we eat the animals, or we eat the plants ourselves.
